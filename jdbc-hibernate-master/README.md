# JDBC and Hibernate
Now that you've mastered SQL, it's time to get back to Java and start asking yourself
"How do I use what I've learnt with SQL and use with Java?".
This is the module that will do that. You'll understand how you can connect to a database 
from Java, how you can perform queries and do some more advanced stuff.

Some of the topics you'll learn are:
- JDBC architecture, components and application
- Hibernate architecture, interfaces and types
- The Hibernate persistence context and associations
- Hibernare Query Language /  Java Persistence Query Language
